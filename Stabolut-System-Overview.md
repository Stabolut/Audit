# Stabolut Protocol - Technical Documentation

## System Overview

Stabolut is a decentralized stablecoin protocol featuring two complementary tokens:
- **USB**: A delta-neutral backed stablecoin pegged to $1 USD
- **SBL**: A governance token earned through staking USB

## Core Architecture

### 1. Smart Contract Components

#### USBStablecoin.sol
- **Purpose**: Main stablecoin token with minting/burning capabilities
- **Features**:
  - ERC20 compliant with burning functionality
  - Upgradeable using UUPS pattern
  - Role-based access control (MINTER, PAUSER, UPGRADER)
  - Circuit breaker for large minting operations (>10% supply increase)
  - Rate limiting per block
  - Maximum supply cap
  - Emergency pause functionality

#### SBLGovernanceToken.sol
- **Purpose**: Governance token with voting capabilities
- **Features**:
  - ERC20Votes implementation for delegation
  - Governance proposal system with configurable parameters
  - Voting delay, period, and quorum management
  - Maximum supply of 1 billion tokens
  - Permit functionality for gasless approvals

#### StabolutEngine.sol
- **Purpose**: Core protocol engine managing delta-neutral strategies
- **Features**:
  - Multi-collateral support with Chainlink price feeds
  - Delta-neutral strategy integration
  - Yield distribution to treasury
  - Collateralization ratio enforcement (150% minimum)
  - Depeg protection mechanisms
  - Emergency pause and circuit breakers

#### StakingContract.sol
- **Purpose**: Stake USB tokens to earn SBL governance tokens
- **Features**:
  - MasterChef-style reward distribution
  - Multiple staking pools with different parameters
  - Bonus multiplier periods
  - Early withdrawal penalties
  - Emergency withdrawal functionality
  - Configurable deposit fees and minimum staking periods

#### Treasury.sol
- **Purpose**: Manages protocol reserves and depeg protection
- **Features**:
  - Multi-asset reserve management
  - Emergency depeg intervention capabilities
  - Timelock for large operations
  - Asset allocation rebalancing
  - Yield distribution to governance or USB burning
  - Circuit breaker mechanisms

### 2. Token Economics

#### USB Stablecoin
- **Peg**: $1 USD
- **Backing**: Delta-neutral strategies + reserve assets
- **Minting**: Users deposit crypto → delta-neutral strategy → mint USB
- **Burning**: Users redeem USB → close positions → return crypto
- **Stability**: Maintained through treasury reserves and algorithmic mechanisms

#### SBL Governance Token
- **Distribution**: Earned by staking USB tokens
- **Supply**: Maximum 1 billion tokens
- **Utility**: 
  - Vote on governance proposals
  - Decide treasury fund allocation
  - Control protocol parameters
  - Emergency interventions

### 3. Delta-Neutral Strategy Flow

1. **User Deposit**: User sends crypto (ETH, BTC, etc.) to StabolutEngine
2. **Price Validation**: Chainlink oracles provide asset prices
3. **Strategy Execution**: Delta-neutral positions opened to hedge price risk
4. **USB Minting**: New USB tokens minted based on collateral value
5. **Yield Generation**: Strategies generate yield from market inefficiencies
6. **Yield Distribution**: 
   - Portion goes to treasury reserves
   - Portion may be distributed to governance
7. **User Withdrawal**: Burn USB → close positions → return crypto

### 4. Governance System

#### Proposal Process
1. **Threshold**: Minimum SBL tokens required to create proposals
2. **Voting Delay**: Time before voting begins
3. **Voting Period**: Duration of voting window
4. **Quorum**: Minimum participation required
5. **Execution**: Successful proposals can be executed

#### Governance Powers
- Adjust protocol parameters
- Manage treasury reserves
- Emergency interventions
- Upgrade smart contracts
- Add/remove supported collateral

### 5. Security Features

#### Access Control
- Role-based permissions across all contracts
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Timelock mechanisms for sensitive changes

#### Circuit Breakers
- Large mint operations trigger circuit breaker
- Emergency pause functionality
- Depeg protection automatic triggers

#### Oracle Protection
- Chainlink price feeds with staleness checks
- Price deviation monitoring
- Fallback mechanisms for oracle failures

#### Upgradeability
- UUPS proxy pattern for all contracts
- Governance-controlled upgrades
- Implementation verification requirements

## Integration with Hadron Platform

The system leverages Tether's Hadron platform features:
- **Asset Tokenization**: Streamlined token creation and management
- **Compliance Integration**: KYC/AML/KYT protocols
- **Multi-blockchain Support**: Deploy across multiple networks
- **Security Infrastructure**: Cryptographic security and multi-sig wallets
